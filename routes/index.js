/**
 * @description: Set of routes for the app. Routing refers to determining how an application responds
 * to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request
 * method (GET, POST, and so on). For example, executing:
 * "app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)"
 * Where:
 * app - is an instance of express.
 * METHOD - is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
 * PATH - is a path on the server.
 * HANDLER - is the function executed when the route is matched.
 * Basically, "routing"  refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests
